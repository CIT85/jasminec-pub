                        This site is about mythical beings that exist due to beliefs and culture or 
                        for the purpose of story telling. This website will introduce you to what Myths are and how they come to be.
                        In addition to that, you'll also get to learn some mythical creatures that you may or may not have heard of.
                        You'll get to learn the description of their appearance and what they are known for.
                        Then maybe you can judge whether they're good or bad beings. Are they real? or not real?

                        This site is for anyone and everyone who is interested in myths and folklores. Anyone whose a big fan of fantasy-like settings like myself.
                        You don't have to believe if these beings are real but knowing that these 
                        kind of entities exist, don't you think they're interesting?

                        It was just some idea I chose to work on for the project but it is based on
                        my own interests. As I said before, I am into fantasy. I don't know everything
                        but I knew there must be a ton of mythical beings out there to add as content. So I chose 
                        this idea of adding content about the listed mythical creatures I've input into the pages.

                        There is a lot I could have done to make this website better but with little time I could only do
                        the best I could into adding the things I've learned. I would add more images somewhere to make it look appealing, like the background
                        images to have nice patterns rather than a blank color. I'd also add better content for the mythical creatures
                        I added. I'm not sure how yet but I feel that I could do better. I'm not sure what new things I could learn in 
                        the future but I definitely need to learn and improve on using grids.
