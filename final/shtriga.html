                        A <strong class="grid-ignore-content">Shtriga</strong> is often depicted as an eerie, unsettling figure blending human and supernatural traits. 
                        In her human form, she appears as a pale, frail woman with sharp, sunken eyes and tangled hair, often living alone at the edge of a village. Her appearance is deceptively ordinary by day, but by night she transforms into a terrifying creature. 
                        Legends describe her with long, bony fingers, claw-like nails, and fangs stained with blood. Some tales say she sprouts bat-like wings or takes the form of an owl or insect to slip through windows in the dark. Her ghastly glow, hollow eyes, and whispered curses mark her as a being of dark sorcery and hunger.

                        The <strong class="grid-ignore-content">Shtriga</strong> originates from Albanian folklore, where it is one of the most feared supernatural beings in traditional legends. The myth dates back centuries and likely has roots in ancient Balkan beliefs about witches, curses, and disease. 
                        In Albania, stories of the <strong class="grid-ignore-content">Shtriga</strong> were told to explain mysterious illnesses or sudden misfortunes that struck families or villages, especially when children became sick for no clear reason. The word <strong class="grid-ignore-content">“Shtriga”</strong> itself comes from the Latin “strix” or “striga,” meaning screech owl or witch, which also 
                        appears in old Roman and Slavic tales. Over time, the <strong class="grid-ignore-content">Shtriga</strong> became a distinctly Albanian figure—a symbol of hidden evil and spiritual corruption within the community.

                    <h4 class="grid-subtitles">Facts of them</h4>
                    <ul class="grid-facts">
                        <li>Albanians traditionally used charms made of silver, garlic, or red thread to protect themselves and their children from the Shtriga’s curse.</li>
                        <li>It was believed that a Shtriga had no reflection, so people sometimes used mirrors to identify suspected witches.</li>
                        <li>Unlike some vampire myths, a Shtriga could heal the victims she had cursed — but only if she chose to, showing that she had both destructive and redemptive power.</li>

                    <p class="grid-p">
                        A <strong class="grid-ignore-content">Shtriga</strong> is believed to be a witch-like creature that preys on the life energy of humans, particularly children. At night, she leaves her body or transforms into a small animal or 
                        flying insect to secretly visit sleeping victims. By sucking out their vitality or “spirit,” the <strong class="grid-ignore-content">Shtriga</strong> causes weakness, illness, or even death. In many tales, she uses spells and curses to spread misfortune across entire villages. 
                        However, the <strong class="grid-ignore-content">Shtriga</strong> is also said to live a double life — appearing as an ordinary woman by day, blending into society unnoticed. Her actions represent jealousy, greed, and the unseen dangers of dark magic in Albanian folklore.
