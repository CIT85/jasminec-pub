# My Topic: The World of Mythical Creatures

## Why I chose this topic
I chose this topic simply because I'm into fantasy. There is many topics to choose from for this project but why not have some fun with it. There a lot of myths and legends on Mythical creatures all around the world. There may be a lot of content I could get about some creatures I'll choose to add like their origin, description, and stories. Some may be known some may not be known. Some may look friendly and some may look scary. My first page could be explaining what are mythical creatures, what myths or folklore means. Then all about the three mythical creatures I may choose, one for each page.
