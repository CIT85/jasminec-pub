                    <h3 class="grid-subtitles">Explanation</h3>
                    <p class="grid-whatmyth-p">
                        Myths, legends, and folklore are traditional stories that have been passed down through generations to explain the world and share cultural beliefs. 
                        Myths are stories about gods, creation, nature, or the universe, often told to explain how something came to be. Legends are stories that may be based on 
                        real people or events, but are exaggerated over time to seem larger than life, such as heroic quests or brave warriors. Folklore includes everyday traditions, tales, beliefs, and superstitions shared among a community or culture. 
                        Together, these stories help people understand their identity, values, fears, and hopes, while also keeping history and imagination alive.

                        Myths, legends, and folklores exist through the ways people create, share, and preserve stories across generations. 
                        Long before written language, communities relied on oral storytelling, allowing tales to be passed down by spoken 
                        word during gatherings, rituals, and celebrations. As people retold these stories, details changed, grew, or adapted to new times, helping the stories stay relevant. 
                        When writing developed, many of these tales were recorded, giving them a more permanent place in history. They also survive through art, songs, dances, 
                        and cultural practices. Today, they continue to exist through books, digital media, movies, and online communities, showing how storytelling evolves while keeping old traditions alive.

                                The "how" to myths also answers the "why" to myths. They existed because people have always needed ways to explain the world around them, especially before science and written history 
                                provided clear answers. These stories help communities make sense of natural events, life, death, and the mysteries of the unknown.
